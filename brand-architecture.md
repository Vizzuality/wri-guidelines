# Brand arquitecture

Is the structure of brands within WRI's global identity. It is the way in which the brands
within a company's portfolio are related to, and differentiated from, one another.

## WRI

Our proposed solution is to create clear rules for when projects may create a new brand or
WRI-affiliated brand, and to develop style guidelines for implementing WRI-affiliated
brands to ensure that these remain consistent, recognizable, and related.

## WRI - Affiliated brands

A WRI-affiliated brand deviates from the WRI brand style, but maintains a number of
elements to remain recognizable as a WRI product. For example, an affiliated brand may
use its own logo and color scheme, and seek a different tone in its presentation. WRIaffiliated
products should still carry the WRI logo and maintain consistency in user
interface elements.

Specific guidelines on affiliated brand implementation are documented in the style guide.
We seek to maintain consistency around interactive elements, maps and charts. We also
seek to maintain consistency in navigation and overall character.
