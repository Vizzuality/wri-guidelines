# Photography

Photographs should always appear human, and in no way slick or overly corporate. The
locality of our work is vitally important, and should be portrayed through the unique
character of each country. Our photography should also clearly illustrate the scale and
complexity of the projects we are working on. Err on the side of creativity in imagery to
balance the complexity of the issues we are conveying to our audiences.

Avoid images that dramatize the effects of smog in the atmosphere, or use Photoshop
techniques to make an environment look unrealistic. Never, ever alter an image except to
crop it or alter color or contrast.
