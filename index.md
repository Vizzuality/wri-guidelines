# Introduction

WRI produces many websites and web applications in partnership with other
organizations. As a result, we need to have clear guidelines as to how partner brands will
work within these sites, and whether or not they will require their own separate brand
identity beyond that of WRI.

We would like to find a common ground that improves the consistency and recognizability
of WRIâ€™s project websites, while providing flexibility for projects with unique identities.
