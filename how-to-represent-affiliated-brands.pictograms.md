# Pictograms

Pictograms can help make information more interesting to look at and easier to
understand. It is very important differentiate pictograms from navigation icons as this ones
are meant to be used as a companion for explanatory content and not to illustrate and
action. They shouldn't go inside a button.

Since we are dealing with an aesthetic element rather than main navigation, it is important
not to occupy too much visual space with pictograms. The house WRI style is solid
elements.
