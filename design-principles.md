# Design principles

These Standards have been developed to help you create better experiences for users and
display the WRI brand in a consistent and coherent way. Here you will find a list of
principles that will help you to be successful.

## Creating consistency among sites

Every brand is able to have a different look and feel but there are some key elements that
need to be common throughout the different products. That way, users will consciously or
unconsciously recognize a brand that belongs to the WRI set of products. The elements
that contribute to creating this consistency include obvious ones such as a common
header and footer, as well as other, more intangible elements that will enforce the branding
system such as grid layout, typography recommendations, user interface elements, icons,
image style, and others.

## Design with data

Keep your audience in mind and design for them, not you. It's a common mistake in design
thinking to assume your users are familiar with your jargon or the same knowledge as you.
Design for your users' needs, customize graphs based on what they need and create easy
to use interfaces thinking that take into account who they are, the technology they are
using, and the outcomes they are expecting.
