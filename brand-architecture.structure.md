# Structure

There are three main structural elements over and below the content on WRI projects
pages: top bar, navigation bar, and footer. Each page of the site is built using them, and
organized using a grid.

Home pages always have a simpler navigation bar for highlighting the main message of the
project. The content is situated below it, followed by a related content module. The last
thing on the page is the footer.

Secondary pages have the title of the content and a second navigation bar for sub-sections
(if any).

Map pages usually don't display standard navigation elements. In their place, they might
optionally show map tools or layers.
